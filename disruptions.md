Man In Regent Street is an installation and performance piece that explores themes of environmentalism, destruction and rebuilding. A four-metre-long score is performed iteratively and progressively destroyed by the performer. The damage inflicted provides the opportunity to restructure and rebuild the piece and as the performance progresses new musical structures and materials emerge as a result of this process. Some words are lost, new melodies and meanings are formed, and details once hidden are uncovered.

This piece was developed in collaboration with performer [Mimi Doulton](http://mimidoulton.com/){:target="_blank"} as part of a [Wild Plum Arts Made at the Red House](https://wildplumarts.org.uk/made-at-the-red-house/){:target="_blank"} residency. The recording was filmed at City, University of London and supported by [The Marchus Trust](https://www.marchustrust.net/){:target="_blank"}. Jonathan Higgins is supported by [PRS Foundationâ€™s The Open Fund](https://prsfoundation.com/grantees/jonathan-higgins-the-open-fund-for-music-creators/){:target="_blank"}.
