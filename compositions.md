During isolation we have looked to the internet to replace in person communication. Zoom and similar services have provided much needed interaction for many. However, those who lack access to the internet are excluded from these virtual social spaces. Wallpaper utilises words from those isolating without access to the internet. In an online recording session their words were read back, performed and manipulated via the imperfections of the internet until digital noise overtook all meaning. These recordings were then arranged to create Wallpaper.<br><br>

Wallpaper exists in two versions: the digital download available here and a hotline available on 0330 818 0351 (calls cost your standard landline rate, if you're outside the UK please call +44 330 818 0351). The phone you use, where you are and the time of day you call will all affect the quality of the playback through the hotline creating a unique ‘version’ of the piece on each listen. As the quality of the call changes different aspects of the piece are filtered out, forefronting or hiding various layers within the music. The EP available on Bandcamp consists of the digital download of Wallpaper and three recordings of the hotline from different phones and locations.<br><br>

Performers: Patricia Auchterlonie, Mimi Doulton, Ella Taylor and Juliet Wallace.<br><br>

Supported by Sound and Music's ‘Interpreting Isolation’ Grants.<br><br>

### Bootlegs (2019)

[Listen on Bandcamp](https://fractalmeat.bandcamp.com/album/bootlegs){:target="_blank"}

An EP of improvisations performed on hacked CD players. Recorded in a feedback loop with each track being a reprocessing of the previous until all trace of the original is lost.

 <summary>Details</summary>

Bootlegs began as two low quality recordings of glitch turntablism gigs. To make the first track of the EP, these raw, unprocessed recordings were burnt to CDs, improvised with and the output recorded in a single continuous take. This improvisation was then burnt to CDs and used as the source material for an improvisation for the second track; this iterative process was repeated for each track on the EP. With each iteration the sounds become further removed from the original bootleg gig recordings until eventually almost all trace is lost. By the end all that is left is the sound of the CD players themselves.<br><br>

Bootlegs is built from sounds recorded at Liquid Sky, Berlin (01.05.19) and Hatch, Sheffield (20.07.19).<br><br>

Released on Fractal Meat Cuts.<br><br>
