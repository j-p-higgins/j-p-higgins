# Jonathan Higgins

I am a composer and performer based in London, England. My music focuses on exploring how noise can be utilised as a creative and generative tool. I work across a variety of different media, including fixed electroacoustic music, instrumental music, live electronics and sound installations. I perform regularly across the UK as an improvisor using a custom setup of hand modified CD players. I am currently working towards a PhD in Music Composition at City, University of London and I have previously studied at the University of Sheffield. My music has been performed, prized and published both nationally and internationally.
