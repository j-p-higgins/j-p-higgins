Noisy, glitchy free improvisation using three hacked Sony Discman players and a cheap DJ mixer. This project came from a frustration with the limitations of digital DJ equipment which, predominantly imitates vinyl. Modifying CD players uncovered a world of noise usually hidden within the circuitry. Utilising these modified players I can warp and glitch the content of the CDs live. This digital, glitch turntablism exploits the noise of digital audio, producing results wholly unlike turntablism using vinyl.

In 2019 I released an EP of Glitch Turntablism title *Bootlegs* on the label [Fractal Meat Cuts](https://fractalmeat.bandcamp.com/){:target="_blank"}. *Bootlegs* began as two low quality recordings of glitch turntablism gigs. These raw, unprocessed recordings were burnt to CDs, improvised with and the output recorded. This process was repeated cyclically to make the four tracks on the EP. By the end all that is left is the sound of the CD players themselves.
